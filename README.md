## Installation
Before installing, read the [ZAP installation instructions](https://framagit.org/zot/zap/blob/master/install/INSTALL.txt) for important information about


### Register a new domain and add it to YunoHost
- Zap requires a dedicated domain, so obtain one and add it using the YunoHost admin panel. **Domains -> Add domain**. As Hubzilla uses the full domain and is installed on the root, you can create a subdomain such as zap.domain.tld. Don't forget to update your DNS if you manage them manually.


#### YunoHost >= 2.5 :
Once the dedicated domain has been added to YunoHost, go again to the admin panel, go to domains then select your domain and click on "Install Let's Encrypt certificate".

### Install the ZAP application
Use the YunoHost admin panel to install Zap by entering the GitHub repo address in the custom app URL

		https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/zap_ynh

Make sure to select your new domain created by the instruction in previous section as the application domain.

**For admin rights**: When installation is complete, you will need to visit your new hub's page and login with the **admin account username** which was entered at the time of installation process. You should then be able to create your first channel and have the admin rights for the hub.

**For normal YunoHost users:** Normal LDAP users can login through Ldap authentication and create there channels.

**If the admin cannot access the admin settings:** If the admin cannot access the admin settings at `https://zap.example.com/admin` or you want to grant admin rights to any other user(s) on the hub, then you have to **manually add 4096** to the **account_roles** under **accounts** for that user in the **database through phpMYAdmin**.

**For logs:** Go to **admin->logs** and enter the file name **php.log**. 

**Failed Database after Upgrade:** Some times databse upgrade fails after version upgrade. You can go to your hub eg. `https://zap.example.com/admin/dbsync/` and upgrade it manually.
